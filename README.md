# SilverPaun Homelab

## Overview

SilverPaun Homelab is a production-inspired self-hosted infrastructure project running on a dedicated Hetzner server.

The primary goal of this project is to develop practical skills in Linux administration, monitoring, automation, observability, security operations and AI-assisted infrastructure management.

The entire environment is built using open-source technologies and documented as a long-term learning and portfolio project.
